The purpose of this project is to create a transparent and immutable voting platform
for OSU students.  The platform can be altered to be used for any voting application
as it pertains to OSU students.  As an example, the platform is setup to count Yes
or No votes, but it can be changed for anything else such as multiple candidate votes.

Currently, the program creates a Python list that will hold the vote results.  This list
cannot be modified and each vote in the list corresponds with a single block.  The blocks
are connected by referring to the block that came beforehand.
